# Mini Chat Bot

Welcome to the **Mini Chat Bot** project!  
This is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates how to build a simple chatbot using basic programming logic and control flow.

## Features

- Responds to simple user inputs with predefined replies.
- Can be easily extended with more commands and features.
- Great for learning how to handle user input in Python.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3

## How It Works

The chatbot takes input from the user and matches it with a set of predefined responses. If it recognizes a keyword or phrase, it returns the corresponding reply. Otherwise, it responds with a default message.

## Sample Interaction
User: Hello
Bot: Hi there! How can I help you today?

User: What’s your name?
Bot: I’m Mini Chat Bot, your friendly assistant.

User: Bye
Bot: Goodbye! Have a nice day!

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
3. Run the script using your terminal or IDE:

```bash
python mini_chat_bot.py
Customization

You can extend the chatbot by adding more keywords and responses in the script:
elif "weather" in user_input:
    print("Bot: I'm not sure about the weather, but I hope it's nice where you are!")
